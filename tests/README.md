# FreeDOS FC unit tests

* RUNME1ST.REX
Run this first.  It is a Rexx script that generates all of the test files for TEST.REX.

This is cross platform.

Run it by:
```
    C:\..\fc\tests> rexx RUNME1ST.REX
```

* TEST.REX
This is test suite script in Rexx.  Written for the Regina interpeter.

The first argument is the exectable for FC. This allows it to point to different executables of FC.EXE.  This is useful for testing multiple versions of FC.

Example:
```
    C:\..\fc\tests> rexx texts.rex ..\fc
```

The exit code returns 0 upon success, upon failure the number of failed tests, and exit code 250+ indicates an error with the testing.

##  Data Files

These are generated by running RUNME1ST.REX.
* Spaces/Tabs Tests
  * SPACES.txt - Example that uses spaces
  * TABS.txt - Example that uses tabs

* Upper/Lower
  * upper.txt - Example uses all upper case text
  * lower.txt - Example uses all lower case text

* Wildcard Tests
  * SAME*.TXT - Copies of the same file.

## Notes
* Here are some terms that mean exactly the same thing and the context where it means that is in parenthesis:  Exit status/exit code/return code, ERRORLEVEL (DOS), and RC (for return code - Rexx).
